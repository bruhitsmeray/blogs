                        I wanted to write a blog monthly so bad but life happened, and lots of stuff changed. But I am here now, letting you know what I've been up to in the last year. I promise that I didn't procrastinate 100% of the time, that's for sure.

                        For the people that were reading my blog last year, you know that I've had some projects in development, such as: HyperionCore, HyperionUI, Aleph, Konsole and Seekr. To make this short, they're all canceled. I do hope to revisit some of them at a later day, most likely after I finish the big one, which is the next topic.

                <h1 class="title"> Decay</h1>
                <div class="part">
                    <p>
                        Decay is the only project that has survived and is mostly the reason I canceled the rest. I want to focus on bringing this project to fruition. But for that to happen, I need to give it all of my work time.

                        One of the first big changes is the upgrade to Unreal Engine 5 and a new UI. In the images I provided, the menu was a classic one that spread throughout the whole screen. Since then, I have switched to a more minimalist design that can be used throughout the whole game.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>The new menu is comprised of multiple windows that can be moved and switched between.</p><br>
                    <p>
                        Among other things, I have added the ability for the player to hide in Lockers and am currently working on multiple maps that will be part of Chapter 1. I'm also planning a Technical Test in the hope that people will provide feedback in regards to the gameplay.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                        The game supports FSR 3.0, XeSS, TSR and hopefully soon DLSS. Controller support will also be in-game at launch. I really want as many people to be able to enjoy Decay. The low-end machine used for testing Decay is a MacBook Pro Mid 2012 with Windows installed. My objective would be to achieve a constant 30FPS on the MacBook at launch.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                        More news regarding the Technical Test should come out closer to Summer.

                        Through this blog post, I just wanted to say "Hi" and let you know what I've been up in the past year. Lots have changed and it's only fair that you guys should be updated too from time to time. For now, all my work will go in developing Decay and getting the Test Build out for y'all to enjoy. There are some more spicy prototypes going on in the background as a way for me to avoid burnout but that is something we'll discuss after Decay is out the doors and in your hands.

                        Thank you so much for reading this. I love you all and I will see you again, soon.
