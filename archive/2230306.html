                    <p>In March, I really wanted to get more stuff done, so I've started by updating "HyperionUI". The Settings page for Game, Audio and Video got polished. Because Decay got some love last month, The plugin also got updated and it now supports FSR 2.2. The Upscaling settings get saved too when switching between Upscaling technologies now.</p>

                    <p>On March 20th, I've started working on Decay again and I gotta say that in just a few days, I've made some pretty good progress. I've managed to complete the blockout for one of the Chapter 1 levels, I've added some assets and logic for some stuff and fixed some bugs.</p><br>
                    <p>March is done. In April we go with much excitement! I'll see you soon, take care!</p>
