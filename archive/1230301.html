                <div class="part">
                    Hi, today I want to take a look at my journey of becoming a programmer so far, starting somewhere in 2019 and finishing with what to expect in the future.

                <h1 class="title">2020</h1>
                <div class="part">
                    <p>
                        For the people that didn't follow me back in 2020 (which is most of you), this is kind of a recreation of an older blog post of mine. A post so old that the design of the blog back then resembled more of a Twitter post than it did a blog post.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                        In that respective post, I was talking about procrastination and my love for Cyberpunk 2077, a game that still stuck around with me until this day, despite public reception at the time. I also talked about the struggles of streaming on Twitch.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                        I ended the blog on quite a negative note if you ask me, 2020 was a hard year for everyone and I didn't know what 2021 had in store for me.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h1 class="title">2021</h1>
                <div class="part">
                    <p>
                        On 21st of November, 2021, I've posted a short blog named "One year later" in which I've talked about how 2021 is nearly over, the blog post redesign and some of the newly started projects.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                        A day later I've postead a new blog named "Let's catch up again". I do remember not having inspiration for a new name for the blog so I just used the same name as in 2020 but slightly changed. In this blog post I've talked about some updates made to my then in-development Discord bot named "Eutera" and about Decay and some other projects.

                <h1 class="title">2022</h1>
                <div class="part">
                    <p>
                        On June 14th, 2022, I've posted a blog named "A new beginning" in which I've mostly just wanted to say "Hi" and talked a bit about some Unreal Engine plugins that I was working on at the time.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h1 class="title">2023</h1>
                <div class="part">
                    <p>
                        Programming is an amazing and creative journey, I don't regret taking this step and I can't wait to create lots of cool stuff.Since last time I did a "Catch up" blog I've started telling y'all about my projects. I'll do this again now, for old time's sake.
                    </p>                    
                </div>

                <h1 class="title">Eutera</h1>
                <div class="part">
                    <p>
                        "Eutera" is kinda broken in 2023, and I can't be bothered to fix it because I'm working on a big upgrade. I promise I'll let y'all know when that is ready, but for now I have some more important projects to deal with, so "Eutera" doesn't have a date when it comes to the next release (for now). 
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h1 class="title">Aleph</h1>
                <div class="part">
                    <p>
                        "Aleph" went through a strange evolution over the years, from a base of future projects and games, to a standalone game. In 2023, "Aleph" is a co-op game, in early development, and yes, more early than "Decay".
                    </p><br>
                    <p>I don't really have anything to say more than that. It still exists. That's it for now, next.</p>
                </div>

                <h1 class="title">HyperionCore & HyperionUI</h1>
                <div class="part">
                    <p>
                        Well these are new. HyperionCore & HyperionUI are two Unreal Engines plugins that I've started developing in Late 2022 and are what "Aleph" was meant to be in the beginning.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                        HyperionCore handles the logic of a game while HyperionUI handles the UI. I've made these plugins to help beginner game devs prototype their ideas faster. I'll make a video showcase after I spend some more time on developing them.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                        I promise it will be worth it, I'm really excited about these two. 
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h1 class="title">Decay</h1>
                <div class="part">
                    <p>
                        Last but not least, "Decay", I can't wait to get back to work on this one. It slowly grows into a beauty, I'm still prototyping stuff, but everytime I get to work on it, it gets better and better. Hopefully by Christmas I'll have a demo ready for y'all to try. 
                    </p>

                <h1 class="title">Goodbye.. for now</h1>
                <div class="part">
                    <p>
                        Wow.. this blog was a long one but I really wanted to take a look back on my journey so far and show you what there is to look forward to.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                        For now, I wish y'all a great day and thanks for reading this! I'll see you later, goodbye!
