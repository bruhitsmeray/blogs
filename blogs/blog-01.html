                            Today, I wanna take a look back in time, right about when I started my journey as a programmer
                            at the end of 2020 & talk about what to expect going forward.

                            If you follow me since I've started this little journey of mine, and I'm guessing most of you don't,
                            this is kind of a remake of an older blog post of mine. A post so old that the page that it was
                            posted on, resembled more of a list of Twitter posts than it resembled a blog post.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            In that post I was talking about how lazy I was for not working on the site and instead playing
                            Cyberpunk 2077, a game that I still love 'till this day, judge me on that, I dare y'all. Anyway,
                            I was also talking about the downsides of streaming on Twitch and that I decided to stream on
                            YouTube instead, something that still didn't happened 'till this day, 3 years later.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            After that was done, I started talking about how I had an album in the works, that was around
                            14 songs long and never ended up releasing although it still sits on iCloud untouched by anybody.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            I then concluded that 2020 was a shitty year as we all know, and that I wasn't able to write, work
                            on "Decay" or see my friends. But was happy because I've learned a lot of new stuff and hoped for a
                            better 2021.

                            On 21th of November, 2021, I've posted a blog called "One year later". It was a really short one,
                            in this one I was talking about how the year I was talking about in my last post has nearly passed,
                            and that in that time, I've started some new projects and re-designed the blog page for the 100th
                            time.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            I was telling everyone that was reading, that my Discord bot "Eutera" got updated and might get
                            back online in 2022, a thing that actually happened surprisingly. And to let history repeat itself,
                            a new update for 2023 is in the works that will bring some exciting stuff, so keep an eye out through
                            the summer.

                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Anyways, I then concluded that 2021 was a pretty good year. Short and simple, right?

                        <p>
                            One day later, I've posted the blog "Let's catch up again". I remember not having inspiration for a new
                            name so I just used the same name as I did one year before, but adding "again" at the end.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Ok, so there's a lot to unpack here, I acknowledged my ghosting from blogging. Not that I really started
                            to begin with, but I did that, I've changed the blog design (again) and then started talking about my
                            new projects. Some more simple than others. I'll mention the important ones here really quick.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h2>Eutera (2021)</h2>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            At that time, Eutera was a pretty important project for me, of course priorities change in time, so in 2023
                            that's a side project more than anything serious. Anyway, back then it was pretty serious for me, so "Eutera 4.5"
                            was a thing.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Why "4.5" and not "5"? Well, because it was the same old Eutera but updated to "Discord.JS 13" and some
                            changes in code. What changes? Only God knows at this point. Anyway, I said that maybe I'd bring it back online
                            at a later date, which I did.

                        <br>
                        <p>
                            This one is tricky. Back then I wanted "Aleph" to become the base for future games and projects in general. It
                            started development in hopes of helping someone dear to me and then just grew bigger in scope from there. More on
                            that later.

                        <br>
                        <p>
                            My sweet baby, "Decay", started development in 2019 and at that time, it was using a lot of code from "Aleph" a bit
                            changed of course, to fit the needs of "Decay".
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Anyway, I've stated that the game is still in early development, a
                            status that didn't change 'till this day and that a demo will be coming at a later date.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            The demo has yet not been released but, I'll make the same promise this year, I'll keep you updated on that.
                        </p>

                            In 2022, I changed the design of the blog page again, but the concept stayed the same, a list of posts that I considered being
                            "blogs" and maybe they were, but didn't look like it.

                            In June of 2022, I posted a new blog named "A new beginning", of what, you might ask? Good question. Anyway, then I started
                            talking about how I did not write for some time (in the blog) and that the change of design was a good oportunity to say "Hi".
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            After doing all of that, I started vaguely mentioning the Unreal Engine plugins I was working on and some "How-to" videos for how
                            to use the plugins that I still have to make. I also started talking about streaming, and never did that again. And that concludes
                            our recap. Now let's get back to the present.

                            Hi! I am here, for real this time. I actually made a list for the blogs, all of them will appear there and you can access them easily.
                            Then you will get redirect to an actual blog, that looks like one, and it's actually nice.

                            Something change while others stay the same for better or for worse. Programming really is a great and creative journey, I don't regret
                            taking this step and I can't wait to create lots of amazing stuff.

                            "Eutera" is kinda broken in 2023, and I can't be bothered to fix it because I'm working on a big upgrade. I promise I'll let y'all know
                            when that is ready, but for now I have some more important projects to deal with, so "Eutera" doesn't have a date when it comes to the

                            "Aleph" went through a strange evolution over the years, from a base of future projects and games, to a standalone game. In 2023, "Aleph"
                            is a co-op game, in early development, and yes, more early than "Decay".

                            Well these are new. HyperionCore & HyperionUI are two Unreal Engines plugins that I started development on in Late 2022 and are what "Aleph"
                            was meant to be.

                            HyperionCore handles the more technical parts of a game while HyperionUI handles the well.. UI. I've made these plugins to help beginner game devs
                            prototype their ideas faster. I'll make a video showcase after I spend some more time on developing them.

                            I promise it will be worth it, I'm really excited about these two.

                            Last but not least, "Decay", I can't wait to get back to work on this one. It slowly grows into a beauty, I'm still prototyping stuff, but
                            everytime I get to work on it, it gets better and better. Hopefully by Christmas I'll have a demo ready for y'all to try and give me some feedback.

                            This blog was a really long one, because now I can write long blog posts.

                            I hope you didn't fall asleep while going through this with me. But I really wanted to do this. Take a look back on my journey and let you know how
                            it goes and for what to look forward.

                            I have some surprises for you that I did not reveal on here. It's not time yet. For now, I'll go back into my whole, and start preparing some of the
                            plugins for release. You'll see which ones really soon.
                        </p>

                            I'll try to post at least one blog post per week, so come back here next week for a shorter blog, but still a blog. I think I actually have shit to say
                            now, plus it helps me relax after work.
                        </p>

                            For now, I hope you have a great day, thanks for coming on this journey with me! I'll see you soon, bye!
